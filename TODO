-test pcie_design with software (seems to be OK for CSR, need to test DMA)
-add wishbone bridge to USB and simulate
-add litescope to wishbone bridge
-test wishbone bridge on hardware (with integrated litescope)
-add mux to connect PCIe TLPs to USB packetizer/depacketizer
-test TLPs reception/injection on hardware
-almost done :)
